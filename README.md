Feistel Network with AES and SHA-256
Overview
This project implements a Feistel network encryption and decryption algorithm enhanced with AES encryption and SHA-256 hashing. The algorithm combines the strength of AES for block encryption and SHA-256 for subkey generation, providing a robust cryptographic solution.

Features
Feistel Network: Utilizes a 20-round Feistel network for encryption and decryption.
AES Encryption: Integrates AES encryption within each round for added security.
SHA-256 Hashing: Generates subkeys using SHA-256 hashing to ensure strong key expansion.
Permutation and Substitution: Implements custom permutation and substitution functions for bit diffusion and confusion.
